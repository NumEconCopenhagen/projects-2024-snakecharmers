# Data analysis project

Our project is titled **Complex models are costly: evidence from the mtcars dataset** and is about the relationship between complexity and costs. Its a simple
and trivial project to apply some simple `python`-code to data using the `pandas`-module.

The **results** of the project can be seen from running [dataproject.ipynb](dataproject.ipynb).

We apply the **following datasets**:

1. ``mtcars`` - a built-in dataset from `R`. See [source](https://www.rdocumentation.org/packages/datasets/versions/3.6.2/topics/mtcars).
